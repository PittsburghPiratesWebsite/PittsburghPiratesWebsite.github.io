        <h2>The Pirates in the 21st Century:</h2>
        <p>The Pirates have not had it well since the start of the 21st Century, they at one time had the longest losing season streak in professional sports history, and had countless seasons with over 100 total losses.</p>
        <h3>The 2013-2015 Playoff Run:</h3>
        <p>In 2012, the Pirates seemed to be headed in the right direction, stars like Andrew McCutchen were performing very well, and the overall team looked like it was about to break out. Once 2013 broke out, they finally put all of the potential to use, making the Wild Card round that year and defeating the Cincinnati Reds at PNC Park. Unfortunately they lost to the ST. Louis Cardinals in the NLDS. The next few years they only got more dominant in the regular season, but in 2014 and 2015 fell in the first round in the Wild Card. They have not been back in the playoffs since.</p>
